ATTENTION: Version 1.07 introduced a bug that would trigger when an entire
directory hierarchy was deleted when all of --name-encrypt, --ne-nesting of
more than 0 and --delete-keys were in effect. All files deleted were
incorrectly removed from the file map, leaving behind dummy entries. Further
attempt to use that file with rsyncrypto would result in a "corrupt filemap"
message and an rsyncrypto abort.

Version 1.09 fixed this bug. It also introduced a new tool, designed to fix the
corruption left behind by the bug. Running the corrupted file map through
rsyncrypto_recover should fix the file and restore it to full working order.
As long as the only message printed during the restore process is
"Rsyncrypto 1.07 corrupted record - safetly discarded" no data loss has occured


Rsyncrypto requires gzip that supports the "rsyncable" flag. The gzip rsyncable
flag is a patch written by Rusty Russell. This patch is available in the
"contrib" directory, and nees to be applied against the *gzip* sources.

Items currently on the todo list for version 2:
1. Treat filename mapping on Windows as case insensitive
2. Sign the encrypted files to allow a third party to verify their integrity.
3. Store meta-information, such as the plaintext file name and other file
   attributes inside the encrypted file.
4. Allow filter mode operation

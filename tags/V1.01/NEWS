Version 1.01 has been released, and declared fully stable and functional.

New to version 0.19:
Rsyncrypto has undergone major performance improvements, both on Linux and on Windows.

New to version 0.16:
rsyncrypto now supports encrypting of the file names. This is done by choosing random names for new files, and storing the translation between the real name and the encrypted names in a file called "filemap", which is also encrypted.

This feature is supported for both "recursive" (-r) and filelist modes. It supports all the operation modes supported by rsyncrypto, including "--delete" when the directory encrypting to has files from more than one directory (usualy achieved via the "filelist" option). Rsyncrypto will, generally, just do the right thing.

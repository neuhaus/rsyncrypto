Rsyncrypto requires gzip that supports the "rsyncable" flag. The gzip rsyncable
flag is a patch written by Rusty Russell. This patch is available in the
"contrib" directory, and nees to be applied against the *gzip* sources.

Version 1.01 is released and ready for production use (fully stable).

Items currently on the todo list for version 2:
1. Treat filename mapping on Windows as case insensitive
2. Sign the encrypted files to allow a third party to verify their integrity.
3. Store meta-information, such as the plaintext file name and other file
   attributes inside the encrypted file.

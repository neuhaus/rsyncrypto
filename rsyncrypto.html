<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page documents the <B>rsyncrypto</B> command.
<P>

<B>rsyncrypto</B> is a utility that encrypts a file (or a directory structure)
in a way that ensures that local changes to the plain text file will result in
local changes to the cipher text file. This, in turn, ensures that doing
<B>rsync</B> to synchronize the encrypted files to another machine will have
only a small impact on <B>rsync</B>'s efficiency.
<P>

<B>rsyncrypto</B> will encrypt files using a symmetric block cipher (AES). Each
file is encrypted using a unique key. The file key is stored in two locations.
One is the &quot;<I>key</I>&quot; file, and the second is inside the encrypted file
itself. The second copy is encrypted using a RSA public key, which can be
shared for all encrypted files.
<P>

Decrypting the file can take place in one of two forms:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Warm Decryption</B>

<DD>
<I>keyfile</I> is used to decrypt <I>srcfile</I> into <I>dstfile</I>.
<DT><B>Cold Decryption</B>

<DD>
If <I>keyfile</I> is lost and <I>key</I> is the <B>private</B> key for the RSA
encryption, extract and create <I>keyfile</I> from the encrypted <I>srcfile</I>,
and create both <I>keyfile</I> and <I>dstfile</I>.
</DL>
<P>

If both <I>keyfile</I> and the private key are not available, decryption cannot
take place. Typically, this means that you would either want to transfer the
encrypted files in whatever way (secure or insecure, but probably <B>rsync</B>
:), and keep the plain text file, as well as the key file, secure. As long as
you saved the RSA private key, you can reconstruct them both.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

The parameters meaning depend on the existence of the <I>-r</I> and <I>-d</I>
flags.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>srcfile</I> or <I>srcdir</I><DD>
This is the source for the operation. This will be the plain text file for
encryption, and the cipher text file for decryption. If the <I>-r</I> option is
given, <I>srcdir</I> is the directory from which files are to be
encrypted/decrypted. Otherwise, <I>srcfile</I> is the file to be
encrypted/decrypted. In any case, <I>src</I> must exist prior to running
<B>rsyncrypto</B>.
<DT><I>dstfile</I> or <I>dstdir</I><DD>
Similar to <I>src</I>, this is the destination of the operation. It will be
the plain text to be created if <I>-d</I> was given, or the encrypted file
otherwise.
<DT><I>keyfile</I> or <I>keydir</I><DD>
The file holding the symmetric key for the encryption, or a directory in which
symmetric key files reside. If the later, the key files will have the same name
as the plain text files.
<DT><I>key</I><DD>
This file can either be a X509 certificate holding a public key, or a PEM format
private key. The private key is never needed unless a cold decryption is
required. See the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+req">req</A></B>(1)

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+x509">x509</A></B>(1)

manual pages for more info.
</DL>
<P>

If <I>dst</I> does not exist, it will be created. The directory in which it
is to be created must exist prior to running <B>rsyncrypto</B>.
<P>

If encrypting, and a symmetric key for the file is found, the same parameters
will be used for the encryption unless the <I>--fr</I> or <I>--fk</I> options
are used. If that's the case, the key file is going to be replaced with the
correct parameters.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`-').
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>, <B>--help</B>

<DD>
Show summary of options.
<DT><B>-V</B>, <B>--version</B>

<DD>
Print out the current version number.
<DT><B>-d</B>, <B>--decrypt</B>

<DD>
Decrypt <I>src</I> into <I>dst</I>. The default behaviour is to encrypt <I>src</I>
into <I>dst</I>, and create <I>keyfile</I> if it does not exist.
<DT><B>-r</B>, <B>--recurse</B>

<DD>
Recursively encrypt/decrypt an entire directory structure. All files under
<I>srcdir</I> will be encrypted to files of the same name and path (almost, see
<I>--trim</I>) under <I>dstdir</I>. If not already there, a key file will be
created for each file under <I>keydir</I>.
<DT><B>--filelist</B>

<DD>
The first argument is a pointer to a file (or &quot;-&quot; for stdin) that has a list
of files to process. Any name ending with a &quot;/&quot; is taken to be a directory in
recursive mode, and any other name is a file name. The second argument is a
directory where the files are encrypted to. --filelist and -r are mutually
exclusive.
<DT><B>-c</B>, <B>--changed</B>

<DD>
Check the src and destination modified time (see --modify-window) prior
to performing the operation. If the modified time is the same, assume that the
files are also the same, and skip the operation. Notice that unlike <B>rsync</B>,
file sizes are not compared. This is because the file size is expected to change
during the encryption (and thus decryption) operation.
<DT><B>--modify-window=</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
Only applicable when <B>-c</B> is in effect. When comparing file modification times,
treat as equal modification times that are <I>num</I> seconds apart. Default value is
zero.
<P>
This option is most useful when the encrypted file is stored on a FAT file system.
FAT can only store modification time with a 2 seconds accuracy. This may result in
the modification time changing between original and encrypted file. In such a case,
<B>--modify-window=1</B> should be used.
<DT><B>-n</B>, <B>--name-encrypt=</B><I>translation_file</I>

<DD>
Encrypt the file name. If this option is specified, this means that file
names are encrypted as well. This is done by changing the name of the encrypted
file to a random string of characters, and storing the translation in the file
given as parameter.
If working in recursive mode, this file is automatically also included in the
encryption, and is given the fixed name &quot;filemap&quot;. This is done so that
decryption of the file names is possible when the symmetric keys are lost.
<DT><B>--ne-nesting=</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
When the --name-encrypt option is used, by default all mangled file names
are stored in a single directory. When encrypting large directory trees, this
can result in rather big directories. Using &quot;--ne-nesting&quot; will split the
files to subdirectories, according to random bits that are part of the
encrypted file name. &quot;n&quot; is the number of directories to nest.
<DT><B>--trim=</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
Determine how many directory levels to trim from the beginning of the <I>srcdir</I>
path when creating directories under <I>dstdir</I>. The default value is 1. See
<B>THE TRIM OPTION</B>

for more details.
<DT><B>--delete</B>

<DD>
When in recursive mode, delete files and directories under <I>dstdir</I> that do
not exist under <I>srcdir</I>.
<DT><B>--delete-keys</B>

<DD>
When deleting files, also delete their symmetric key and file name mapping (if
applicable). When only <B>--delete</B> is used, the symmetric key and file
mapping are kept, so that if the file is recreated, it will be rsyncable with
the original file. This option implies <B>--delete</B>.
<DT><B>-b</B><I>num</I><B> --keybits=</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
Specify the block cipher's key size. For AES, these can be 128, 192 or 256.
Note that unless the <I>--fr</I> or <I>--fkP options are also specified, this
will only affect files for which no keyfile</I> exists.
<DT><B>--noatime=</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
(Only on some platforms, most notably Linux). The platform usually keeps track of when
files were last being accessed. Since <B>rsyncrypto</B> is typically used for backup, it
opens the files it encrypts with the O_NOATIME option, which is a Linux specific
extension that tells the system not to update the file's access time. When opening a
file where the opening process is not owned by the file owner, an attempt to open the
file with O_NOATIME will cause the open to fail with &quot;permission denied&quot;.
<BR>&nbsp;
<I>num</I> can be one of these options:
<B>0</B> means do not use O_NOATIME at all.
<B>1</B> (the default) means attempt to only use O_NOATIME if <B>rsyncrypto</B> thinks it
will not cause a permission denied error.
<B>2</B> means to use O_NOATIME always.
<DT><B>--no-archive-mode</B>

<DD>
Do not try to preserve timestamps. This option is incompatible with <B>-c</B>.
<DT><B>--gzip=</B><I>path</I>

<DD>
By default, <B>rsyncrypto</B> will compress the plain text prior to encrypting
it. In order not to become rsync unfriendly due to the compression,
<B>rsyncrypto</B> will search the path for an instance of
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+gzip">gzip</A></B>(1)

that supports the <I>--rsyncable</I> option. If the system's default gzip does
not support this option (all Debian and derivatives, as well as some others, support it), use
this option to tell <B>rsyncrypto</B> to use a different instance of gzip. The
tests directory of rsyncrypto's source has a file called &quot;gzip&quot;, that does NULL
compression by redirecting the input and output to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+cat">cat</A></B>(1).

<DT><B>--roll-win=</B><I>num</I>, <B>--roll-min=</B><I>num</I>, <B>--roll-sensitivity=</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
Affects the rolling block algorithm. See <B>NOTES</B>.
<DT><B>--fk</B>, <B>--fr</B>

<DD>
If command line, or a version with different defaults, dictate different
values for the <I>--roll-*</I> options or the <I>-b</I> option, these will only
affect files for which <I>keyfile</I> does not yet exist. specifying the
<I>--fk</I> or <I>--fr</I> will recreate <I>keyfile</I> if it has values different
than those in the previous key file.
<DT><B>-v</B>, <B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Increase verbosity level. Specify several times to be more verbose.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<B>encrypting stdin</B>

<P>

If <I>srcfile</I> is given as `-', the plain text data will be read fro stdin.
This does not yet work for decompression (see <B>BUGS</B>).
<P>

<B>--roll-win</B>=num, <B>--roll-min</B>=num, <B>--roll-sensitivity</B>=num

<P>

These values affect some of the inner workings of <B>rsyncrypto</B>'s decision
making.  In particular, these affect how <B>rsyncrypto</B> decides when to
revert to the IV.
<P>
These options should not be played with unless you understand what you are
doing. They are not dangerous, in that they will never cause data loss. Any
value should still allow decryption of the file. They do have an affect on
<B>rsync</B>'s efficiency.
<P>

These options are only there to allow quick response in case a security problem
pops up with their default values. If that happens, an advisory may come out
giving new values to fill in as a workaround. Until that happens, most users
are advised to leave these options alone.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE TRIM OPTION</H2>

When running <B>rsyncrypto</B> in recursive mode, the directory structure under
<I>srcdir</I> is re-created under <I>dstdir</I>, with one directory stripped from
the path. In other words, if we have a directory structure which has:
<P>

a/b/c/file
<P>

running <B>rsyncrypto</B> with <I>srcdir</I> of &quot;a/b&quot;, and <I>dstdir</I> of &quot;f&quot;
will create &quot;f/b/c/file&quot;.
<P>

The <I>--trim</I> options lets the user say how many parts to trim from
<I>srcdir</I> when creating directories under <I>dstdir</I> and <I>keydir</I>. If, in the
above example, we said
<I>--trim</I>=0

then &quot;f/a/b/c/file&quot; would have been created. Likewise, if we said
<I>--trim</I>=2

then &quot;f/c/file&quot; would have been created.
<P>

It is an error to give a trim value which is higher than the number of
directory parts actually in <I>srcdir</I>. In the above example,
<I>--trim</I>=3

would result in an error.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY</H2>

The roll values affect, to a not totally known degree, how much information
is &quot;leaked&quot; between plain text and cipher text. The default values are supposed
to leak less than 20 bits of aggregated information about the plain text file
for every 8KB, in the worst case. These values, we hope, will be considered
secure enough for most usages. However, if your country's fate is at stake, use
a non-rsync optimized encryption, such as the one provided by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+openssl">openssl</A></B>(1).

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES AND TUTORIAL</H2>

<P>

Before starting to use rsyncrypto you will need a public key in X509
certificate format. The quickest way to generate one of these is using the
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+openssl">openssl</A>(1) package. To generate a new 1536 bit RSA key as &quot;backup.key&quot;, and
store the corresponding unencrypted public key in &quot;backup.crt&quot;, use the
following command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:1536 -x509 -keyout backup.key -out backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

It does not matter what you answer for the certificate details, or when you set
it to expire. Rsyncrypto ignores everything in the certificate but the actual
key.
<P>

To encrypt file &quot;data&quot; into &quot;data.enc&quot;, storing the file's specific key at &quot;data.key&quot;, run:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto data data.enc data.key backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

Anywhere in these examples that &quot;backup.crt&quot; is used, &quot;backup.key&quot; can be used
as well. The above could also have &quot;backup.key&quot; as the last argument. If these
examples list &quot;backup.key&quot; specifically, then it means that &quot;backup.crt&quot;
<B>cannot</B>

be used instead.
<P>

&quot;data.enc&quot; will be created. If &quot;data.key&quot; exists from a previous run, then the
newly created &quot;data.enc&quot; will have the same symmetric key and other attributes,
thus maintaining the rsync friendliness of the encryption. It is therefor
important to provide any previous key file for the data if one is available.
<P>

The command line to decrypt the file depends on whether you have the key file
used when the file was encrypted. If you do, then decryption can take place
using only the public key, with the following command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto -d data.enc data.dec data.key backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

If the key file was lost, the private key must be used to recover it from the
encrypted file using the following command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto -d data.enc data.dec data.key backup.key</TT>
</DL>

<P>

&quot;data.key&quot; will be created by the above command, as well as &quot;data.dec&quot;.
<P>

Use of rsyncrypto to encrypt whole directories is similar, with directory names
replacing file names in the above example. To encrypt the content of a
directory called &quot;data&quot; to a directory called &quot;enc&quot;, storing the symmetric keys
in a directory called &quot;keys&quot;, run the following command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto -r data enc keys backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

As before the directories &quot;enc&quot; and &quot;keys&quot; will be created if they do not
already exist. The directory structure under &quot;plain&quot; will be duplicated under 
&quot;enc&quot; and under &quot;keys&quot;. That is, if there is a file called &quot;foo&quot; under &quot;data&quot;,
an encrypted files called &quot;foo&quot; will be created under &quot;enc&quot;, and a key file
named &quot;foo&quot; will be created under &quot;keys&quot;. In other words, the first part of the
path to &quot;data/foo&quot; (the part that says &quot;data&quot;) is eliminated from the path, and
this determines the name of the files under &quot;enc&quot; and &quot;keys&quot;.
<P>

If a different trimming is required, the --trim option can be used. To have
rsyncrypto create &quot;enc/data/foo&quot; instead of the above, use the following
command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto -r --trim=0 data enc keys backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

Instead of taking all files from a single directory, it is possible to supply
rsyncrypto with a list of files and directories which to encrypt. This is done
using the --filelist option, like so:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto --filelist --trim=0 list enc keys backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

&quot;enc&quot; and &quot;keys&quot; retain the same meaning as before. &quot;list&quot; is a text file with
a list, one per line, of files to encrypt. The --trim=0 option says that if
list contains a line saying &quot;/home/foo/bar&quot; which states the name of a file,
then an encrypted file called &quot;enc/home/foo/bar&quot; will be created. Without it,
the file will be called &quot;enc/foo/bar&quot;. Likewise, with --trim=2, the file
would be created as &quot;enc/bar&quot;.
<P>

It is often a problem that the file names are not encrypted. If that is the
case, we can ask rsyncrypto to encrypt the file names, as well as the actual
files. Rsyncrypto does not actually encrypt the file names. Instead, it
replaces the actual file name with a random series of characters. The mapping
between the actual file name and the garbled name is stored in a mapping file.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>rsyncrypto --name-encrypt=map --trim=0 -r plain enc keys backup.crt</TT>
</DL>

<P>

This will encrypt the &quot;plain&quot; directory structure into enc, exactly as before.
Unlike before, all files will be directly under the &quot;enc&quot; directory, and will
be named as a meaningless garble. A file called &quot;map&quot; will be created under the
current directory that contains a map between the gabled and the real name of
the file. In addition, two files, called &quot;enc/filemap&quot; and &quot;keys/filemap&quot;, will
also be created. These are the encrypted and key file corresponding to the &quot;map&quot;
file mentioned above. During decryption, if &quot;map&quot; does not exist, it will be
created by decrypting &quot;enc/filemap&quot;.
<P>

<B>Important note:</B>

When performing filename encryption, it is vitally important to give the correct
--trim values, both during encryption and during decryption. Failing to do so
will cause rsyncrypto to search for non-existing file names, and to fail to
locate the files to decrypt.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Not providing a correct key file may result in segmentation fault.
<P>

It is not yet possible to decrypt using password protected private key.
<P>

Decrypting from stdin is not yet supported.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Important Note !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In version 0.05 the meaning of the parameters have changed incompatibly!
The first variable now means "source file" and second one means "destination
file". Before, the first file was the "plain text file" and the second was
"cypher text file".

As a result of this change, encryption still behaves the same, but for
decryption argument order must be reversed. Don't forget this or you may erase
your encrypted files!

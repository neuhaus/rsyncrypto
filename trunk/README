Rsyncrypto requires gzip that supports the "rsyncable" flag. The gzip rsyncable
flag is a patch written by Rusty Russell. This patch is available in the
"contrib" directory, and nees to be applied against the *gzip* sources.

As of version 0.10, rsyncrypto is officially in a "beta" state. This means
mainly that functionality and interface is not expected to significantly
change until the program can be declared "stable".

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Important Note !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In version 0.05 the meaning of the parameters have changed incompatibly!
The first variable now means "source file" and second one means "destination
file". Before, the first file was the "plain text file" and the second was
"cypher text file".

As a result of this change, encryption still behaves the same, but for
decryption argument order must be reversed. Don't forget this or you may erase
your encrypted files!

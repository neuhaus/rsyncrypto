Rsyncrypto requires gzip that supports the "rsyncable" flag. The gzip rsyncable
flag is a patch written by Rusty Russell. This patch is available in the
"contrib" directory, and nees to be applied against the *gzip* sources.

As of version 0.10, rsyncrypto is officially in a "beta" state. This means
mainly that functionality and interface is not expected to significantly
change until the program can be declared "stable".

Items currently on the todo list:
1. Treat filename mapping on Windows as case insensitive
2. Sign the encrypted files to allow a third party to verify their integrity.
3. Store meta-information, such as the plaintext file name and other file
   attributes inside the encrypted file.

Items already done:
1. Create a native Windows version (done as of 0.14).
2. Encrypt the file names (done as of 0.16).
